# **📊 Data Analysis Internship - Level 1 (Task 2)**  
### **Restaurant Data Analysis: Ratings & Pricing Trends**  

## **📖 Introduction**  
This project is part of my **Level 1 Data Analysis Internship**, where I analyze a dataset containing information about restaurants. The focus of this task is to **examine restaurant ratings, pricing trends, and customer preferences**.  

By utilizing **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, I performed data cleaning, extracted key insights, and visualized restaurant trends to understand how pricing affects ratings.  

---

## **📌 Task Overview**  
In this task, I analyzed a restaurant dataset to:  
✔️ **Identify rating distribution** across different price ranges.  
✔️ **Analyze the correlation between restaurant pricing and ratings.**  
✔️ **Find the most highly-rated restaurant types and locations.**  

This analysis helps businesses understand how pricing impacts customer ratings and which types of restaurants receive the highest satisfaction.

## **🔍 Solution Walkthrough**  

### **1️⃣ Data Preparation**
- **Imported necessary libraries:**  
  - `Pandas` for data handling  
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations  
  - `Matplotlib & Seaborn` for visualization  
- **Loaded the dataset** from a CSV file.  
- **Performed data cleaning** by handling missing values and correcting inconsistent data.  

### **2️⃣ Rating & Pricing Analysis**
- Examined the **distribution of restaurant ratings**.  
- Segmented restaurants based on **pricing categories (low, medium, high)**.  
- Analyzed whether **higher-priced restaurants tend to receive better ratings**.  
- Used **correlation analysis** to determine relationships between pricing and customer satisfaction.
